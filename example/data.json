Kansas City Fed president Esther George expressed concern that the Fed's bond buying would destabilise financial markets.<\/p><p>Mr Bernanke - who has spent much of his time in office persuading more hawkish colleagues of the merits of QE - was authorised by the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee to deliver the unusual verbal statement.<\/p><p>Markets reacted to the perceived hawkishness of the committee by significantly bringing forward expectations for when the Fed will start to raise US short-term interest rates from their current historic low of between zero and 0.25%.<\/p><p>Although Mr Bernanke made clear in the statement that the Fed did not expect to raise rates until well into 2015, futures markets priced in a 50% chance of a rate rise by September next year.<\/p><p>China worries<br \/>The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Friday 0.3% higher, partly reversing a 2.3% drop on Thursday - its biggest one-day fall of the year.<\/p><p>Technology stocks did badly, after Oracle announced disappointing results, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index closing 0.2% lower.<\/p><p>Behind the bearish tone was a rise in long-term interest rates, as markets continue to price in expectations that the Fed will start raising short-term US interest rates sooner than previously thought.<\/p><p>The 10-year yield on US Treasuries - the benchmark for the Federal government's long-term cost of borrowing - rose from 2.41% to 2.54%. In early May it stood at less than 1.7%.<\/p><p>The prospect of higher returns in the US dragged the dollar higher against most other currencies, up 0.7% against the euro, 0.5% against sterling and 0.6% against the yen.<\/p><p>It also drove long-term borrowing costs marginally higher in other countries, including the UK and eurozone.<\/p><p>Another factor that spooked markets on Thursday was news of record high borrowing costs in China this week, raising fears of a Chinese credit crunch and a stalling of the world's growth engine.<\/p><p>However, the apparent stress in the country's banking sector appeared to ease somewhat on Friday as the People's Bank of China intervened.<\/p><p>As a result, commodities markets - in which Chinese demand plays a dominant role - had a somewhat mixed day.<\/p><p>The oil price fell further, with Brent crude futures dropping 1.2% to just under $101 a barrel.<\/p><p>Industrial metals - many of which are intensively used in China's construction boom - were more resilient, with copper rebounding 0.7%.<\/p>"
